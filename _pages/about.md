Hi! I am a PhD student at [Purdue ECE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) 
where I work with [David I. Inouye](https://www.davidinouye.com/). 
I have a track record of publishing in top conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, and AISTATS, 
and industry research experience at Amazon and Bloomberg.

My research focuses on the *development and evaluation* of Machine Learning (ML) models, including conventional deep learning
models and foundation models, that are **robust and trustworthy** when faced with *complex data shifts in test cases* and *undesirable
bias in pretraining data*, enabling safe and effective deployment in dynamic real-world environments.

To solve this problem, I have leverage tools including (1) causality ([NeurIPS24](https://openreview.net/forum?id=J0Itri0UiN), 
[ICLR24](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v1VvCWJAL8)) (2) Generative AI models ([ICLR23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uhLAcrAZ9cJ),
[AISTATS22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/zhou22b), Amazon Internship)(3) domain knowledge (Bloomberg Internship)

Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or just want to chat. I am always open to new ideas and collaborations.

üîç **I am expected to graduate in Spring 2025 (flexible). Please let me know if you have any openings for a Machine Learning Researcher/Engineer or a Quantitative Researcher**

üîç **I am also looking for a research internship in Winter/Summer 2025. Please let me know if you have any openings.**
