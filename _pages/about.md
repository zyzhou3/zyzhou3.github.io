Hi! I am a PhD student at Purdue ECE where I work with [David I. Inouye](https://www.davidinouye.com/). 

Essentially speaking, I am seeking to answer the question: **"How can we make machine learning more 
robust and reliable?"**







My research keywords are as follows:

(1) Distribution Shift

(2) Trustworthy ML (robustness, fairness)

(3) Causality

(4) Generative Models

I have a track record of publishing in top conferences like ICLR and AISTATS, and industry research experience at Amazon and Bloomberg.

**I am looking for a research internship in Summer/Fall 2024. Please let me know if you have any opening.**

Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or just want to chat. I am always open to new ideas and collaborations.
