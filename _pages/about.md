Hi! I am a PhD student at [Purdue ECE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) 
where I work with [David I. Inouye](https://www.davidinouye.com/). 
I have a track record of publishing in top conferences like ICLR and AISTATS, 
and industry research experience at Amazon and Bloomberg.

Essentially speaking, I am seeking to answer the question: **"How can we enhance the robustness and reliability of 
machine learning?"**

More specifically, I am interested in understanding the following questions:

(1) *How can we make machine learning models more robust to complex distribution shifts?*

(2) *How can we make machine learning models more efficient from the perspective of data and computation?*

(3) *How can we address these issues in applications such as scientific discovery and finance?*

To answer these questions, I have leverage tools including (1) causality ([ICLR24](https://openreview.net/forum?id=v1VvCWJAL8))
(2) generative models ([ICLR23](https://openreview.net/forum?id=uhLAcrAZ9cJ), [AISTATS22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v151/zhou22b))
(3) domain knowledge (Bloomberg Internship)



üîç **I am looking for a research internship in Summer/Fall 2024. Please let me know if you have any opening.**

üîç Feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in my research or just want to chat. I am always open to new ideas and collaborations.
