Hi! I am a PhD student at Purdue ECE where I work with [David I. Inouye](https://www.davidinouye.com/). My research keywords are as follows:

(1) Trustworthy ML (robustness, fairness)

(2) Distribution Shift

(3) Causality

(4) Generative Models

I have a track record of publishing in top conferences like ICLR and AISTATS, and industry research experience at Amazon and Bloomberg.
